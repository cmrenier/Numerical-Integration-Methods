LU Factorization

This algorithm was created to use partial pivoting to determine the LU factorization of a square matrix of any size.

The user will input A, the coefficient matrix, that will be factored.

The algorithm will output L (the lower triangular matrix), U (the upper triangular matrix), and P (the pivot matrix).

This algortihm requires a square matrix to run successfully.
